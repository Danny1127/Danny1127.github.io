					<h3>Course Overview
					</h3>
					<p>Game Theory is the study of strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. The focus of the course will be on Economic applications of Game Theory, but the knowledge of Game Theory can be extended to many other different fields. For example, Game Theory has many applications to Biology (Evolutionary Game Theory), Psychology (Behavioral Game Theory), Computer Science, Mathematics, and other social sciences.
					</p> 			
					<h3>Course objectives and expected learning outcomes: 					
					</h3>
					<p>This course presents the key fundamentals of Game Theory, with various applications to real world situations. Upon completing the course, students will have a basic understanding of the important concepts, analytical results and insights of Game Theory, a knowledge of where Game Theory can be applied and the ability to formally represent and analyze certain problems strategically.

					<h3>Course Overview
					</h3>
					<p>Classical economics models assume self-interest rational individual
						optimize their benefit or utility. Behavioral economics applies
						psychological insights into economic analysis to explain individual
						decision-making. This course introduces some major models of
						behavioral economics and empirical evidence underlying them.
					</p> 			
					<h3>Course objectives and expected learning outcomes: 					
					</h3>
					<p>One of the important goals for economic analysis is to predict human
						behavior. The objectives for this course are closely relate to this goal: 1)
						Apply models from behavioral economics to prediction. 2) Be exposed
						to empirical evidence that individual may systematically deviate from
						“rational” decision. Through this course, students will develop skills to
						utilize fundamental techniques building on game theory, experiments,
						and nonparametric statistics.
