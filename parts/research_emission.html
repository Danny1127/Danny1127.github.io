				<h3>Abstract
				</h3>
				<p>					
					The coal-fired power plant industry is a major polluting source of various emissions, including greenhouse gas (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>). Previous studies find unintended emission leakages across spatial and time when power plants are expecting changes in the environmental regulations. In this paper, I consider the emission leakage from coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) as they approach retirement. I illustrate the increasing emission rates from such EGUs and explore the underlying reasons for the trends. Using a semi-log fixed effects model, I find a 4% efficiency drop in the final year of operation, which is around two standard deviations of the normal efficiency. In the final year of operation, each EGU on average emits 78.88 million lbs CO<sub>2</sub> (1.6%), 0.88 million lbs NO<sub>x</sub> (10.1%) and 5.01 million lbs SO<sub>2</sub>(16.9%) more than the baseline level in 2012. Controlling for the start-up and shutdown frequency can explain about 43% of the efficiency lost. The efficiency lost explains almost all CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate increase but only 20% of the increase in the NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> emission rates. EGUs under fee-for-service regulation exhibit a sudden efficiency drop in the final year of operation, while their counterpart, the not regulated ones, show lower efficiency in the last three years of operation. The results draw attention to a new aspect of emission leakage in the extensive operation margin.
