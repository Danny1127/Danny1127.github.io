				<h3>Abstract
				</h3>
				<p> Uncertainty in regulatory policies may delay decision making which leads to a suboptimal regulation outcome. The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) is an environmental policy that went through several legal challenges and was subject to high uncertainty before its compliance date. I measure the subjective belief regarding the MATS remaining in place using a modified single-agent investment and exit model. The dynamic structural model parallelizes a difference-in-differences framework using the coal-fired power plants’ investment and exit decisions to reveal the subjective probability of the MATS policy relative to local mercury rules. I estimate that the probability of MATS remaining in place was around 80\% before the compliance year. Had the decision-makers firmly believed in the enforcement of the MATS, the number of coal-fired electric generating units installing the abatement technologies to reduce mercury and retiring would have been larger, and vice versa.
