				<h3>Abstract
				</h3>
				<p>	The coal-fired power plant industry is a major polluting source of var-
ious emissions, including greenhouse gas (CO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and
nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>). Beginning in around 2012, many coal-fired power
plants in the U.S. have started to retire, which creates a chance for evalu-
ating their end-of-business-cycle polluting behavior. This paper examined
the emission patterns of the coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs) when
they approach retirement. I found a 4% efficiency drop in the last year of
operation. The emission rates increase as EGUs approach retirement. As
a result, in their final year of operation, each EGU on average emits 78.88
million lbs CO<sub>2</sub> (1.6%), 0.88 million lbs NO<sub>x</sub> (10.1%) and 5.01 million lbs
SO<sub>2</sub>(16.9%) more than the baseline level in 2012. Controlling for the start-
up and shutdown frequency can explain about 43% of the eficiency lost. The
efficiency lost explains almost all CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate increase but only 20% of
the increase in the NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> emission rates. EGUs under fee-for-service
regulation exhibit a sudden efficiency drop in the final year of operation,
while their counterpart, the not regulated ones, show lower efficiency in the
last three years of operation.
